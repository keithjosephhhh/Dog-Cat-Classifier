# Dog-Cat-Classifier

## Link to the Project App : https://dogcatpreds.streamlit.app/

### main.py contains the python code to the website I created using streamlit for easy application of the ML Model
### ModelPrep.ipynb is the jupyter notebook I used to create the model
### As the dataset was more the 100MB even after zipping it, so I was unable to upload it on GitHub. Here is a Google Drive link for it : https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1dZvL1gi5QLwOGrfdn9XEsi4EnXx535bD
